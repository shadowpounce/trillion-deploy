            that enhances its reputation in the market. This policy records

          <h3>1. Description of money laundering and terrorism financing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Trillion Digital defines money laundering (“ML”) as activity which
              is designed to conceal or disguise the true origin of criminally
              derived proceeds in order to make them appear to have been sourced
              from legitimate sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Terrorist Financing (“TF”) is considered to be the act of
              providing financial support to terrorism or terrorist
              organisations to enable them to carry out acts of terrorism.
            </li>

          <h3>2. Objectives of Trillion Digital’s AML/CTF policy</h3>
          <p>
            Trillion Digital has established an AML/CTF policy which sets the
            core principles for the management of ML/TF risk. The policy is
            global in nature and outlines group-wide standards to meet
            regulatory and ethical obligations in the economies in which
            Trillion Digital does business. This contributes to the stability,
            integrity and strength of the global financial system and protects
            Trillion Digital from reputational damage and regulatory action. The
            Policy is subject to regular review to ensure it remains current
            with regulator expectations and industry standards
