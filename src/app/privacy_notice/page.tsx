            We collect personal information to provide you with our services.
            When we require certain personal information from users it is
            because we are required by law to collect this information, or it is

            that is not required is voluntary. You are free to choose whether to
            provide us with the types of personal information requested, but we
            may not be able to serve you as effectively or offer you all of our
            services when you do choose not to share certain information with
            us. For example, we collect personal information which is required
            under the law to open an account or execute a transaction. We also
            collect personal information when you use or request information

          <p>
            Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide
            you with a secure, smooth, efficient experience. In general, we use
            personal information to create, develop, operate, deliver, and
            improve our services, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud
            purposes. We may use this information in the following ways:

        <section>
          <h3>To maintain legal and regulatory compliance</h3>
          <p>
            Some of our core services are subject to laws and regulations
            requiring us to collect and use your personal identification
            information, formal identification information, financial
            information, transaction information and employment information. For
            example, Trillion Digital must identify and verify customers using
            our services in order to comply with anti-money laundering and
            terrorist financing laws across jurisdictions. The consequences of
            not processing your personal information for such purposes is the
            termination of your account as we cannot perform the services in
            accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. EEA Residents:
            For individuals who reside in the European Economic Area (including
            the United Kingdom) or Switzerland (collectively “EEA Residents”),
            pursuant to Article 6 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
            (GDPR) or any equivalent legislation (collectively “EEA Data
            Protection Law”), we process this personal information to comply
            with our legal obligations. To enforce our terms in our user
            agreement and other agreements. Trillion Digital handles very
            sensitive information, such as your identification and financial
            data, so it is very important for us and our customers that we are
            actively monitoring, investigating, preventing, and mitigating any
            potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and/or violations of
            our posted user agreement or agreement for other services. The
            consequences of not processing your personal information for such
            purposes is the termination of your account as we cannot perform our
            services in accordance with our terms.

          <p>
            We send administrative or account-related information to you to keep
            you updated about our services, inform you of relevant security
            issues or updates, or provide other transaction-related information.
            Without such communications, you may not be aware of important
            developments relating to your account that may affect how you can
            use our services.

            training to make sure we continue to provide you with accurate
            information. If we do not process personal information for quality
            control purposes, you may experience issues on the services such as
            inaccurate transaction records or other interruptions. Our basis for
            such processing is based on the necessity of performing our
            contractual obligations with you. We will not use your personal
            information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed
            to you, without your permission

          <h3>Information From Third Party Resources</h3>
          <p>
            From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third
            party sources as required or permitted by applicable law, such as
            public databases and ID verification partners. Public Databases & ID
            Verification Partners: We obtain information about you from public
            databases and ID verification partners for purposes of verifying
            your identity. ID verification partners use a combination of
            government records and publicly available information about you to
            verify your identity. Such information includes your name, address,
            job role, public employment profile, status on any sanctions lists
            maintained by public authorities, and other relevant data. We obtain
            such information to comply with our legal obligations, such as
            anti-money laundering laws. Pursuant to EEA Data Protection Law, our
            lawful basis for processing such data is compliance with legal
            obligations. In some cases, we may process additional data about you
            to ensure our services are not used fraudulently or for other
            illicit activities. In such instances, processing is necessary for
            us to continue to perform our contract with you and others.

          <h3>How We Protect and Store Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            We understand how important your privacy is, which is why Trillion
            Digital maintains (and requires its service providers to maintain)
            appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to
            protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information
            you entrust to us. We may store and process all or part of your
            personal information in the US and elsewhere in the world where our
            facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your
            personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and
            procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and
            regulations. For example, we use computer safeguards such as
            firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls
            to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal
            information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their
            job responsibilities. However, we cannot guarantee that loss,
            misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will
            not occur. Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or
            confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us
            by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS,
            since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves
            and until it reaches us.

            with you, or to take steps at your request prior to entering a

          <ol>
            <li>
              Right to withdraw consent. You have the right to withdraw your
              consent to the processing of your personal information collected
              based on your consent at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect
              the lawfulness of Trillion Digital’s processing based on consent
              before your withdrawal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right of access to and rectification of your personal information.
              You have a right to request that we provide you a copy of your
              personal information held by us. This information will be provided
              without undue delay subject to some fee associated with gathering
              of the information (as permitted by law) unless such provision
              adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. You may also
              request us to rectify or update any of your personal information
              held by Trillion Digital that is inaccurate. Your right to access
              and rectification shall only be limited where the burden or
              expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks
              to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of
              persons other than you would be violated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to erasure. You have the right to request erasure of your
              personal information that: (a) is no longer necessary in relation
              to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
              (b) was collected in relation to processing that you previously
              consented, but later withdraw such consent; or (c) was collected
              in relation to processing activities to which you object, and
              there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing. If
              we have made your personal information public and are obliged to
              erase the personal information, we will, taking account of
              available technology and the cost of implementation, take
              reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other
              parties that are processing your personal information that you
              have requested the erasure of any links to, or copy or replication
              of your personal information. The above is subject to limitations
              by relevant data protection laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to data portability. If we process your personal information
              based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the
              processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to
              receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used,
              and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal
              information directly to another “controller”, where technically
              feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the
              rights and freedoms of others. A “controller” is a natural or
              legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone
              or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
              processing of your personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to restriction of or processing. You have the right to
              restrict or object to us processing your personal information
              where one of the following applies:
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we
              processed. In such instances, we will restrict processing during
              the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your
              personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              The processing is unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of your
              personal information and request the restriction of its use
              instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of
              the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise
              or defense of legal claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether
              the legitimate grounds of Trillion Digital’s processing override
              your rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restricted personal information shall only be processed with your
              consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal
              claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or
              legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will
              inform you if the restriction is lifted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notification of erasure, rectification, and restriction. We will
              communicate any rectification or erasure of your personal
              information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom
              your personal information has been disclosed unless this proves
              impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will inform you
              about those recipients if you request this information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Right to object to processing. Where the processing of your personal
            information is based on consent, contract, or legitimate interests
            you may restrict or object, at any time, to the processing of your
            personal information as permitted by applicable law. We can continue
            to process your personal information if it is necessary for the
            defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by
            applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right to lodge a complaint. If you believe that we have infringed
            your rights, we encourage you to contact us first at
            info@trilliondigital.io so that we can try to resolve the issue or
            dispute informally. You can also complain about our processing of
            your personal information to the relevant data protection authority.
            You can complain in the EU member state where you live or work, or
            in the place where the alleged breach of data protection law has
            taken place.

            Storage of your personal information. Trillion Digital will try to
            limit the storage of your personal information to the extent that
            storage is necessary to serve the purpose(s) for which the personal
