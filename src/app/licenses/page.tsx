              * U.S. currency is legal tender backed by the U.S. government.

              from supply and demand in the global marketplace which can rise or
              fall independently of any fiat (government) currency.

            LOSS AT THE TIME THAT SUCH CURRENCIES ARE EXCHANGED FOR FIAT
            CURRENCY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE. A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE
            RATE AT THE TIME OF EXCHANGE CAN RESULT IN A TAX LIABILITY. PLEASE
